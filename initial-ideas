**Concept:**  
An e-commerce site offering curated fishing tackle kits (‚Äúpacs‚Äù) tailored to specific lakes, seasons, and fish species. Uses scraped and crowd-sourced fishing reports to identify trending lures and techniques.

- **External APIs (optional enrichment):**  
  - OpenWeather (lake weather and conditions)  
  - USGS (water levels)  
  - Reddit/FB fishing groups (crowdsourced mentions)

**Why:**  
This ties directly to my entrepreneurial side (JWL Enterprises). It blends data scraping, full-stack development, and e-commerce features (Stripe checkout). It also demonstrates how to scale a model (start with Sam Rayburn Reservoir, then expand to other lakes).
