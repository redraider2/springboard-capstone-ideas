# Springboard Capstone Project ‚Äì Initial Ideas

This document outlines my three initial project ideas for the Capstone. Each includes a high-level concept, potential data sources, and why it‚Äôs interesting. My current top choice is highlighted at the end.

## 1. üé£ TacklePacs: Lake-Specific Fishing Tackle Subscription Service

**Concept:**  
An e-commerce site offering curated fishing tackle kits (‚Äúpacs‚Äù) tailored to specific lakes, seasons, and fish species. Uses scraped and crowd-sourced fishing reports to identify trending lures and techniques.  

**Data Sources:**  
- **Custom API:** I will design an API and database to store fishing reports, guide updates, and tackle metadata.  
- **External APIs (optional enrichment):**  
  - OpenWeather (lake weather and conditions)  
  - USGS (water levels)  
  - Reddit/FB fishing groups (crowdsourced mentions)

**Why:**  
This ties directly to my entrepreneurial side (JWL Enterprises). It blends data scraping, full-stack development, and e-commerce features (Stripe checkout). It also demonstrates how to scale a model (start with Sam Rayburn Reservoir, then expand to other lakes).  
‚û°Ô∏è **This is my current favorite project.**

## 2. üöó RoadTrip Planner App

**Concept:**  
An app for planning U.S. road trips with routes, stops, and attractions. Users can save trips, share them, and discover recommended restaurants, parks, and scenic drives.  

**Data Sources:**  
- **External APIs:**  
  - Google Maps API (routes, travel times, attractions)  
  - Yelp or TripAdvisor API (restaurants & reviews)  
- **Custom API:** User login, saved trips, and favorites.  

**Why:**  
This app combines mapping, user accounts, and integrations with major platforms. It‚Äôs widely relatable and demonstrates GIS/data integration, which aligns with my career interests.

## 3. üá®üá∑ Costa Rica Retirement & Relocation Guide

**Concept:**  
A resource hub for retirees and expats considering Costa Rica. Features include cost-of-living calculators, healthcare options, visa guidance, real estate info, and local service directories. Could also include community features (Q&A, personal stories).  

**Data Sources:**  
- **External APIs:**  
  - OpenExchangeRates (currency conversion)  
  - OpenWeather (weather data)  
- **Custom API:** Backend for articles, locations, and services.  
- (Optional) Integration with Costa Rican government or embassy resources.  

**Why:**  
This project draws on my Peace Corps and relocation experience. It demonstrates my ability to build a content-driven, resource-rich platform with potential real-world use.

## üöÄ Preferred Project

My top choice is **TacklePacs** because it:  
- Solves a real-world problem with entrepreneurial potential.  
- Demonstrates database/API design from scratch.  
- Has clear expansion potential (multi-lake dashboards, subscriptions, GIS maps).

## Next Steps
- Share these ideas with my mentor for feedback.  
- Narrow down to a single project.  
- Begin technical scoping and API exploration.
